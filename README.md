This code uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a fractal tree pattern. 
It defines a recursive function draw_fractal_tree that draws branches of decreasing length, creating the fractal effect. 
The main function sets up the turtle and starts drawing the fractal tree. 
You can adjust the parameters and modify the code as needed.
